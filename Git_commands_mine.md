[Removing files/folders in
Git](https://www.jquery-az.com/remove-file-directory-git/)

git rm --cached file1.txt

git commit -m "remove file1.txt"

And to push changes to remote repo

git push origin branch_name

**Example Remove a directory from the local repo and the remote rep**

-   git rm -r Week12

-   git commit -m "Removed"

-   git push

**Deleting multiple files example**

Suppose, we have a folder name “del-demo” that contains five text files
(tst1.txt, tst2.txt tst3.txt tst4.txt tst5.txt). We want to remove three files
by the single command and upload the changes. This is how it can be done:

\$ git rm del-demo/tst2.txt del-demo/tst3.txt del-demo/tst4.txt

**The output should be:**

rm ‘del-demo/tst2.txt’

rm ‘del-demo/tst3.txt’

rm ‘del-demo/tst4.txt’

Now run the commit command:

\$ git commit -m “Removed three text files”

Now you are good to go for making a push and making changes online.

[How to remove a file from the remote repo
(GitHub)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2047465/how-can-i-delete-a-file-from-git-repo)

If you deleted a file from the working tree, then commit the deletion:

git commit -a -m "A file was deleted"

And push your commit upstream:

git push

PMuhuri\@CCASTA-HWJP0G2 MINGW64 /c/sascourse (master)

\$ git branch -m backup_folders SASCourse_rev

PMuhuri\@CCASTA-HWJP0G2 MINGW64 /c/sascourse (master)

\$ git push origin :backup_folders

PMuhuri\@CCASTA-HWJP0G2 MINGW64 /c/sascourse (master)

\$ git push --set-upstream origin SASCourse_rev

Remove a file from index with git rm --cached before commit
===========================================================

The cached option specifies that the removal should happen only on the staging
index. Working directory files will be left alone.
